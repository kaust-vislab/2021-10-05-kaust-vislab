  The Visualization Core Lab will host a Version Control using Git for (Data) Scientists workshop. 
  Visualization lab staff will provide an introduction to version control using Git designed for 
  learners with little or no previous experience working with automated version control.
</p>
<p>
  Version control is the lab notebook of the digital world: it’s what professionals use to keep 
  track of what they’ve done and to collaborate with other people. Every large software 
  development project relies on it, and most programmers use it for their small jobs as well. And 
  it isn’t just for software: books, papers, small data sets, and anything that changes over time 
  or needs to be shared can and should be stored in a version control system.
</p>
<p> 
  In this workshop we will be using Git from the Unix shell. Some previous experience with the 
  shell is expected.  
</p>
<p>
  Topics covered will include the following.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Automated Version Control</li>
  <li>Setting up Git</li>
  <li>Creating a Repository</li>
  <li>Tracking Changes</li>
  <li>Exploring History</li>
  <li>Ignoring things</li>
  <li>Remotes in GitHub</li>
  <li>Collaborating</li>
  <li>Conflicts</li>
  <li>Open Science</li>
  <li>Licensing</li>
  <li>Citation</li>
  <li>Hosting</li>
  <li>Using Git from JupyterLab</li>
  <li>Using Git from R-Studio</li>
</ul>

  This hands-on lesson is part of the <em>Introduction to Data Science Workshop Series</em> 
  being offered by the KAUST Research Computing Core Labs as part of our on-going efforts to build 
  capacity in core data science skills at KAUST. The workshop curriculum largely follows the 
  <a href="http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/">curriculum</a> developed by 
  <a href="{{site.swc_site}}">Software Carpentry</a>, a volunteer project dedicated to helping 
  researchers get their work done in less time and with less pain by teaching them basic research 
  computing skills.
</p>
<p>
  This is a live-coding based workshop and learners are expected to bring their own laptops with 
  the required software already downloaded and installed.
